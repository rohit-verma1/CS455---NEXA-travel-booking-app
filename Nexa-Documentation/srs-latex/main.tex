\section{\centering{\textbf{Overall Description}}}
\subsection{Product Overview}
Our product, Nexa, is designed to revolutionize the travel booking experience by providing a comprehensive online platform for ticket booking and management across various transportation modes, including buses, trains, and flights. Ideal for daily commuters, tourists, and business travelers, Nexa serves as a centralized system that connects customers with verified service providers, allowing seamless searches, bookings, and real-time updates. The platform addresses common pain points such as fragmented services, unreliable availability information, and complex management of reservations.
The software streamlines user interactions by enabling customers to search for routes, view dynamic pricing, book tickets for multiple passengers, and manage post-booking activities like cancellations or rescheduling with penalties for last-minute changes. Service providers can onboard, manage their routes and schedules, monitor bookings, and access analytics. Nexa incorporates AI/ML features for personalized recommendations, itinerary planning, and demand forecasting. It also includes a dummy payment system for simulations, loyalty programs, notifications, and community forums to enhance user engagement and retention. Overall, the platform optimizes the travel planning process, ensuring efficiency, transparency, and user satisfaction.
\
\
\subsection{Product Functionality}
\begin{itemize}
\item Separate dashboards for customers and service providers, with \textbf{administrative access} using designated usernames and passwords.
\item Provision for customers to \textbf{register}, \textbf{log in}, and manage profiles, with options for subscribed users to access enhanced features like loyalty programs.
\item Advanced search and filtering for travel options by route, date, time, category (bus, train, flight), price, rating, duration, and departure time.
\item \textbf{Real-time visibility} of seat/slot availability, with interactive seat maps where applicable.
\item Booking system allowing multiple passengers per transaction, application of discounts or promotions, and secure payment simulations (cards, UPI, wallets, net banking).
\item Post-booking management including cancellations, rescheduling (with penalties), refund tracking, and viewing booking/payment history.
\item Onboarding and management for new service providers, including verification, profile editing, and discontinuation/deletion of accounts.
\item \textbf{Dynamic pricing} adjustments based on demand, time, and other factors.
\item AI-based features for trip planning via chatbot, personalized recommendations, and integration of agentic AI for strategic enhancements like demand forecasting.
\item \textbf{Notification system} for booking confirmations, updates (delays, cancellations), promotions, and loyalty reminders.
\item \textbf{Customer feedback} mechanisms, including ratings, reviews, issue reporting, and community forums for discussions.
\item Analytics for providers and admins, including occupancy rates, revenue trends, and system health metrics.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Design and Implementation Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
\item As the user and booking database grows, the system must efficiently manage and store data related to bookings, user profiles, schedules, and payments.
\item To ensure real-time information about seat availability and tracking, the implementation of efficient communication protocols between the server, providers' systems, and user devices is crucial.
\item The platform, as of now, is available only in English, with potential for multilingual support in future iterations.
\item With a large user base, the system must handle simultaneous booking requests, prevent overbooking/double booking, and support at least 100 daily active users and 250+ bookings per day during peak usage.
\item Deployment on cloud services (e.g., AWS, GCP) with constraints on not exhausting free-tier limits.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
\begin{itemize}
\item The platform seamlessly integrates with external APIs for real-time tracking (e.g., FlightRadar, Indian Railways, bus GPS) and payment simulations.
\item Users are held accountable for their bookings; in cases of disputes or fraud, providers and admins manage resolutions effectively.
\item Service providers supply accurate schedule and availability data, and the system depends on their timely updates to avoid discrepancies.
\item The admins manage any changes, additions, or verifications for providers and platform policies.
\item The system assumes stable internet connectivity for users and providers, with dependencies on secure protocols like HTTPS for data transmission.
\end{itemize}

\section{\centering{\textbf{Other Non-Functional Requirements}}}
\subsection{Performance Requirements}
The software should maintain \textbf{99.5\% uptime}, ensuring that customers and service providers
can access ticket booking and management services with minimal disruptions, excluding scheduled
maintenance windows. The system must support at least \textbf{250 ticket bookings per day} 
and \textbf{100 concurrent users}, scalable seamlessly during peak usage periods (e.g. festival seasons, flash sales).  

The response time for booking, cancelation, or modification requests should be
\textbf{$\leq$ 3 seconds} under normal conditions. The platform must implement \textbf{ load balancing and autoscaling} when deployed on cloud infrastructure
(AWS/GCP/Azure) to handle sudden spikes in traffic.  

Furthermore, the system should include \textbf{fault tolerance and automated recovery mechanisms}, 
ensuring minimal downtime in the event of hardware, network, or software failures.

\subsection{Safety and Security Requirements}
The system must ensure robust safety and security across all operations:  

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User Authentication \& Role Management:} Secure authentication with role-based access (provider vs. customer) must be implemented. Multifactor authentication (MFA) should be available for providers.  
    \item \textbf{Data Encryption:} All sensitive information (personal data, reservation details, and payment information) must be encrypted both in transit (TLS/HTTPS) and at rest. 
    Passwords must be securely stored using salting and hashing.  
    \item \textbf{Secure Transactions:} Even dummy payments must go through a secure payment API. Transactions should be validated, duplication prevented, and users are notified of the results.  
    \item \textbf{Fraud Prevention:} Booking validation must prevent double booking and overbooking. AI-based anomaly detection can be used to identify suspicious activity (for example, bots that spam the bookings).  
    \item \textbf{Cloud \& Physical Security:} Since the system is deployed in the cloud, strict IAM policies and firewall protections must be applied. Only authorized personnel may access server instances.  
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software Quality Attributes}

\subsubsection{Usability}
The system should provide \textbf{separate dashboards} for customers and providers, 
with intuitive workflows for booking, cancellations, modifications, and provider 
onboarding. It must comply with \textbf{WCAG accessibility standards} to ensure 
access for all users. Additionally, \textbf{AI-powered assistance} (e.g., chatbot support) 
should be integrated to help users navigate the platform.

\subsubsection{Availability}
In case of a cloud service crash, the system should restore services within 
\textbf{1 hour} using automated recovery scripts and snapshots. The platform must 
scale dynamically to handle \textbf{high demand (e.g., 10$\times$ normal load during 
peak travel seasons)}.

\subsubsection{Reliability}
The \textbf{Mean Time to Failure (MTTF)} must be at least one week under production 
load. The system shall undergo \textbf{unit, integration, load, and regression testing} 
before deployment. Booking operations must consistently return correct results 
(e.g., no duplicate seats assigned).

\subsubsection{Portability}
The application will be developed using \textbf{Django (backend)} and 
\textbf{Bootstrap + EXT JS (frontend)} with cloud deployment. It should run 
smoothly on \textbf{desktop, tablet, and mobile browsers}. The platform must also 
support \textbf{migration across cloud providers} (AWS, GCP, Azure) with minimal 
reconfiguration.

\section{\centering{\textbf{Other Requirements}}}
\subsection{Legal Requirements and Copyright}
User data collected should be stored in the country’s regional data center. This is to comply with data protection and privacy rules that may be enforced by the Government of the nation. 
\\
Copyright of the source code and the documents must be retained by the developers of the system.

\subsection{Authentication}
Permission will be required for utilising OTPs for the authentication process as this will require sending automated emails to the user's email id.
