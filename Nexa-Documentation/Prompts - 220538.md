1. As you know we are making an Online Travel Booking and Management System. (Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn). Now the Task is to make the Booking pages For the customers to book flights. The booking can be done in 4 stages (Flight Selection -> Review -> Add-ons-> Payment) we will go step by step starting with Review Page. I have attached images (by scrolling) of ixigo review & traveller details page for reference. I want our site to look and feel premium, each components, input dropdown should give premium experience, should look & feel elegant. Provide code for the Flight Selection tsx and its location

2. Now implement the Payment page. I have again attached screenshots of how ixigo implemented it. I want our site to look and feel premium, each components, input dropdown should give premium experience, should look & feel elegant.

3. And Now finally the Add-ons Page.Here we will have have to animate the whole plane layout plane has 40 rows. each row has 6 seats (3 left, 3 right) except for row 28 where there are 4 seats. (in each row seats are labeled A B C D E F). Lets assume from backend we dynamically get the list of seats already booked. we have to display them in gray. the seats in row 1 are in red because they are premium seats.

4. For our Travel Booking Website Nexa, Almost All Page designs Are done. Just Need A beautiful, Elegant, Well thought out design for the Webpage which comes after booking a trip is done. Like it has to give customers a satisfaction for booking their ticket. Below is the model for Booking in our backend. We need to include details regarding the booking ( and also links for further actions, option to download the Ticket Confirmation, Blogs etc think of what all an be included) Booking{ booking_id string($uuid) title: Booking id readOnly: true status string title: Status Enum: [ Pending, Confirmed, Cancelled ] payment_status string title: Payment status Enum: [ Pending, Paid, Refunded ] total_amount* string($decimal) title: Total amount booking_date string($date-time) title: Booking date readOnly: true customer string title: Customer readOnly: true service Service{ service_id Service idstring($uuid) title: Service id readOnly: true provider_user_id Provider user idstring title: Provider user id readOnly: true route Route{ route_id string($uuid) title: Route id readOnly: true source* string title: Source maxLength: 100 minLength: 1 destination* string title: Destination maxLength: 100 minLength: 1 distance_km* number title: Distance km estimated_duration* string title: Estimated duration via_points Via points{ } } vehicle Vehicle{ vehicle_id string($uuid) title: Vehicle id readOnly: true seats [...] registration_no* string title: Registration no maxLength: 50 minLength: 1 model* string title: Model maxLength: 100 minLength: 1 type* string title: Type maxLength: 50 minLength: 1 capacity* integer title: Capacity maximum: 2147483647 minimum: 0 amenities Amenities{ } status* string title: Status Enum: Array [ 2 ] } pricing Pricing{ pricing_id string($uuid) title: Pricing id readOnly: true base_fare* string($decimal) title: Base fare currency Currency[...] dynamic_pricing_enabled boolean title: Dynamic pricing enabled current_price* string($decimal) title: Current price min_price* Min price[...] max_price* string($decimal) title: Max price last_updated string($date-time) title: Last updated readOnly: true } policy Policy{ policy_id string($uuid) title: Policy id readOnly: true cancellation_window* integer title: Cancellation window maximum: 2147483647 minimum: 0 Hours before departure cancellation_fee* string($decimal) title: Cancellation fee reschedule_allowed boolean title: Reschedule allowed reschedule_fee* string($decimal) title: Reschedule fee no_show_penalty* string($decimal) title: No show penalty terms_conditions* string title: Terms conditions minLength: 1 } route_id* Route idstring($uuid) title: Route id vehicle_id* Vehicle idstring($uuid) title: Vehicle id pricing_id* Pricing idstring($uuid) title: Pricing id policy_id* Policy idstring($uuid) title: Policy id departure_time* Departure timestring($date-time) title: Departure time arrival_time* Arrival timestring($date-time) title: Arrival time status Statusstring title: Status Enum: Array [ 3 ] created_at Created atstring($date-time) title: Created at readOnly: true updated_at Updated atstring($date-time) title: Updated at readOnly: true } passengers [ readOnly: true BookingPassenger{ passenger_id string($uuid) title: Passenger id readOnly: true name* string title: Name maxLength: 100 minLength: 1 age* integer title: Age maximum: 2147483647 minimum: 0 gender* string title: Gender maxLength: 20 minLength: 1 document_id string title: Document id maxLength: 50 x-nullable: true seat Seat{ seat_id string($uuid) title: Seat id readOnly: true seat_no* string title: Seat no maxLength: 10 minLength: 1 seat_class* string title: Seat class maxLength: 20 minLength: 1 is_blocked boolean title: Is blocked vehicle* string($uuid) title: Vehicle } }] ticket Ticket{ ticket_id Ticket idstring($uuid) title: Ticket id readOnly: true ticket_no* Ticket nostring title: Ticket no maxLength: 50 minLength: 1 qr_code Qr codestring title: Qr code x-nullable: true issued_at Issued atstring($date-time) title: Issued at readOnly: true is_valid Is validboolean title: Is valid } status_logs [ readOnly: true BookingStatus{ status* string title: Status maxLength: 50 minLength: 1 timestamp string($date-time) title: Timestamp readOnly: true remarks string title: Remarks x-nullable: true }] } Now COuld you create a Page.tsx (next.js, Shadcn components, Awesome animations, Tailwind Css) for this page.. Use minimalist design language but needs to be elegant and informative, satisfying. DO your best, think deep about each and every aspect o the code. For now we dont have the APIs; so present dummy data (The Mail Booking Info Card Must be extremely beautiful)

5. We are building a Travel Booking Website (Nexa) using next js, tailwind css, shadcn ui, tsx files. in which I want to make a page for Booking Buses, Below I have attached 6 images for the idea of how our page should look like. In the 1st image observe the overall page layout. 1. you have a header which contains the search bar, 2. Below at the left there is a filters card. when no filter is selected show the whole list. Types of Filters to Add 1. AC / Non-AC 2. Seat Type. (Sleeper/ Seater) 3. Operators 4. Pickup Point - {"From" City (from the search bar)} 4. Drop Point - {"To" City (from the search bar)} 5. Pickup Time - {"From" City (from the search bar)} 6. Drop Time - {"To" City (from the search bar) } 3. Now to the right of filters card, at the top we will have A date panel which should be scrollable, The default date selected would be the one inputed to the search bar (in the header). and have the range of 5 days to its left and 5 to its right which can be scrolled and selected in this panel, On selecting certain date it should update the date in search bar in the header with the selected date. 4. Now to the main part, Below the dates panel we will have our bus cards. Exactly as shown in the image, The intricacy is that we will have a navigation menu at the bottom of each card which would have options - Amenities, Pickup & Drop Points, Ratings & Reviews, Policies and finally select seats. Clicking on these options should expand the card size to show their particular information exactly as shown in the last 5 images. Most complex of these is the Select Seats Dropdown because here we will have to implement a seat map of the bus layout based on which the user can select his seat. Beside this seat map the user should have 2 scroll area to select Pickup and Dropdown points. And click continue to book the seat. (The seat maps should have seats for seaters icons and Bed icons for Sleeper seats)

For now we dont have the backend fully built So I would like you to Generate Dummy data. Make sure the Data is such that it tests every functionality we are implementing from frontend. (Filters etc)

I will explain the api calls we will implement later and their responses. 1st API Call - Given (To, From, Departure date) Response - All the Trips satisfying this. For each trip we get The Name of the Travels (Operator), Departure Time, Arrival Time, Rating, No of Reviews, No of Seats Left, AC/ Non-AC, Seater/ Sleeper. (using these we will make the bus cards, Cost of a Normal Seat)

All the options below will have its own dedicated API to call, For Seat Selection the API will return the no of Rows, No of Columns, Seater/ Sleeper, The list of seats which are booked, list of seats which are premium (Rest will automatically be taken as normal, normal seats should be green, premium should be blue and booked seats should be blocked) and Pickup Points and Drop Points. Cost Of Premium Seats and Cost of Normal Seats.

We wont have options for Upper Berth, Lower Berth, No promotional content on the page.

Based on the given images and Description, Generate Code for this page.tsx, I want you to be rigorous with the implementation and produce a Premium, Elegant, Beautiful and Usable Webpage. Every component, Transition, Clicks, ANimation should be extremely Smooth, User must enjoy using the Site

   Now that you have a clear vision in mind, Could you Generate the file for provider view I want our Website for providers to look and feel the best. They should enjoy the experience of using it. Also dont make static files, integrate all the functioning, where ever backend apis are needed fill them up with dummy data for now, but all the UI elements must work. Though the you can set dummy data values for now but make sure the functionalities arent hard coded. that is changing the list sizes or inputs inside the variables should impact the functioning.Implement all the filters, popups, dropdowns beautifully, below is our model for building APIs, you can take them as reference for making the dummy data. later we will replace that data with API responses.Also pls make sure the page can toggle between light and dark mode, our main focus would be on light mode though
