--My user models and views, and services models and views are done for my app.
Now I need to redesign my views and logic for bookings and payments that will complete my services and stuff.
As per the SRS, define my payments and booking apps that enable everything I’ve mentioned as my features.
I want individual search APIs for flights, buses, and trains.

--I was hoping to integrate search inside the bookings app — like under bookings/search

--I want normal 3 APIs for searching each mode and one for an AI multimodal search.
Also, give me the complete bookings normal logic and payments — models, views, and serializer files.

--Where are my normal search APIs?
Also, they should be completely integrated with payments.

--In my search though, I want to search by class too.
I’ve already provided class details in my service models.
I want details of the relevant class only to be sent to the frontend.

--Produce ready-to-drop, full-file versions for:
payments/views.py, payments/serializers.py, payments/urls.py, and the management command (so I can just copy and paste them).

--I have uploaded both bookings and services — fix bookings now.
I have individual service models for all modes.

If it’s too much trouble, then write bookings for each mode individually, and also make models for booking each mode individually.

--Now, as per my SRS and SDD, using my existing tables, make me the analytics application.

One set of APIs should be for the provider dashboard, and another for the ratings and reviews for customers.

For buses and trains, provider-based reviews are needed.
For trains, reviews should also work by train number.

Add all other provider dashboard analytics — such as total income, average occupancy, total bookings, and whatever else is important.
